Flask CRUD Application
A web application built using Flask, a SQL database, and Bootstrap v5 for styling. This application allows users to perform CRUD operations on a student database using the WampServer64 for SQL server. Built in Pycharm Community

Introduction:
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.
MYSQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.
Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
WampServer64 is a Windows web development environment. It allows you to create web applications with Apache2, PHP, and the MySQL database. WampServer64 is available for Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP. It is licensed under the GNU/GPLv3.
Pycharm Community is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language. It is developed by JetBrains (formerly known as IntelliJ), and is available as an Apache 2 Licensed community edition, and in a proprietary commercial edition.
